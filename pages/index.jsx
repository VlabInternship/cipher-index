              <p>Cryptography is the science of secure communication in the presence of adversaries. At its core, it is a discipline that seeks to achieve three primary goals: <strong className="font-semibold">confidentiality, integrity, and authentication</strong>, collectively known as the CIA triad. Confidentiality ensures that information is accessible only to authorized parties. Integrity guarantees that data has not been altered or tampered with. Authentication verifies the identity of the communicating parties. These principles are realized through the transformation of a readable message, known as <span className="key-term">plaintext</span>, into an unreadable form called <span className="key-term">ciphertext</span>. This transformation is guided by a key, a piece of information that is crucial for both the encryption and decryption processes.</p>
              <p>A fundamental distinction in cryptography is between symmetric and asymmetric key systems. <span className="key-term">Symmetric-key algorithms</span>, also called secret-key cryptography, use the same key for both encryption and decryption. This requires both the sender and the receiver to securely possess this shared key prior to communication. In contrast, <span className="key-term">asymmetric-key algorithms</span>, or public-key cryptography, utilize two different, mathematically linked keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be shared openly, while the private key must be kept secret, thereby solving the problem of secure key distribution that symmetric systems face.</p>
              <p>Another key classification is based on how algorithms process data. <span className="key-term">Block ciphers</span> encrypt data in fixed-size chunks, or blocks, of a given length, such as 64 bits or 128 bits. If the message is not an exact multiple of the block size, padding is added to complete the final block. <span className="key-term">Stream ciphers</span>, on the other hand, encrypt data one bit or byte at a time, continuously generating a pseudo-random keystream that is combined with the plaintext. Finally, cryptographic design relies on two core concepts introduced by Claude Shannon: <span className="key-term">confusion</span> and <span className="key-term">diffusion</span>. Confusion obfuscates the relationship between the key and the ciphertext, making it difficult for an adversary to deduce the key from the ciphertext. Diffusion disperses the statistical properties of the plaintext over the entire ciphertext, ensuring that changing a single plaintext bit affects many ciphertext bits, thereby obscuring patterns. The following report will explore how these principles are applied across a diverse range of cryptographic algorithms.</p>

              <p className="mb-6">The eighteen algorithms explored in this report represent a chronological and conceptual journey through the evolution of cryptography. From the manual, paper-and-pencil ciphers of the 19th and early 20th centuries to the software- and hardware-optimized algorithms of the modern era, the field has continuously adapted to new threats and technological advancements.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">The transition from the Vigen√®re and Playfair ciphers to modern block ciphers like DES and AES demonstrates a fundamental shift from human-centric to machine-centric design. The advent of the Feistel structure provided a reliable, provably invertible blueprint for iterative ciphers, a concept that underpins DES. This evolution continued with AES, a new standard selected through a public competition, a process that built a level of trust and transparency that DES had famously lacked.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">The rise of algorithms like ChaCha20 and SPECK shows that the goal of cryptographic design is no longer just about defeating cryptanalysis; it is also about adapting to new computing environments. ChaCha20, an elegant refinement of Salsa20, demonstrates that an already-secure algorithm can be improved for better performance on modern, multi-core processors. Similarly, SPECK was developed to address the specific needs of the burgeoning Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem, where power and memory are severely constrained.</p>
              <p className="mb-6">The introduction of asymmetric cryptography by RSA was a revolution in itself. By solving the key distribution problem, it enabled secure communication on a global scale and laid the groundwork for the modern internet. Meanwhile, HMAC provides a sophisticated and elegant solution to a more specific problem: ensuring data integrity and authenticity without relying on complex public-key infrastructure.</p>

            <p>The Vigen√®re cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text by using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A key is used to determine which shift is applied to each letter of the plaintext.

The beauty of this structure is that decryption is simply the same process in reverse order, using the subkeys in the opposite sequence.</p>

              <div className="section-content">
                <p>The IDEA cipher is a block cipher that operates on 64-bit blocks using a 128-bit key. It was designed by Xuejia Lai and James Massey in 1990 and is known for its use of three different mathematical operations on 16-bit sub-blocks to achieve strong diffusion.</p>

                  <p>Secure, but Largely Superseded by AES</p>
                </div>
                <p>While still considered secure, its adoption declined with the rise of AES. It remains an important historical example of a strong, non-Feistel block cipher design.</p>
